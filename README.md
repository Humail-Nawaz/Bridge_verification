# Complete Bridge Verification

This repository contains the source code and testbenches for the **Complete Bridge** project, which implements and verifies an AXI-to-Wishbone and Wishbone-to-AXI bridge and associated peripherals.

## Project Overview

The project aims to design a bidirectional bridge between the AXI and Wishbone bus protocols. This allows communication and interoperability between modules using different bus interfaces in FPGA-based SoCs.

The repository includes:

- Verilog source files for the AXI-Wishbone bridge (`complete_bridge.v`) and related modules.
- Testbenches for functional verification of the bridge and peripherals.
- Simulation scripts and configuration files for running the testbenches.
- A dummy Wishbone memory and AXI ip model for simulation and verification.
- Vivado project files (excluded from GitHub via `.gitignore`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xilinx Vivado Design Suite (for synthesis and implementation)
- Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, VCS, or XSIM)
- Git (for version control)

### How to Run Simulations

1. Open the Vivado project (if applicable).
2. Run the provided testbenches in your preferred simulator.
3. Verify the waveforms and output logs to ensure correct bridge behavior.

### How to Build and Synthesize

Use Vivado GUI or TCL scripts to synthesize the design and generate the bitstream for your FPGA board.
